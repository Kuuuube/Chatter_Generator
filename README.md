## Disclaimer:

### Chatter Generator has the potential to trip anti-cheats in some games when using high Chatter Intensity. I am not responsible for any consequences you may face from the use of this plugin.

Reasonable use of Chatter Generator to add moderate amounts of chatter, shake, or noise is unlikely to cause issues.

## Explanation of the values:

**Chatter Intensity:** The amount of chatter to be added.

**Frequency:** The rate at which reports should be sent when using **Chatter Generator Variable Rate**. 

## Explanation of the filter types:

**Chatter Generator Match Rate:** Adds chatter every tablet report, matching your current tablet's report rate.

**Chatter Generator Variable Rate:** Allows a custom rate to be set for chatter to be generated from.
